            The site labels uploaded MRI scans, allowing you to learn neuroanatomy using your own brain. In the future, we anticipate providing
            more features that will inform and engage users with neuroscience via their own brain.

            By uploading your brain scan and completing surveys online, you are contributing to a unique
            data resource for psychology and neuroscience researchers. Only researchers affiliated with a
            recognized research institution who complete an online application will be allowed access
            to your data, and no identifying information (i.e. email, birth date, full name if provided) will be shared.

            Your imaging and any survey data are uploaded to a secure server which stores the original upload (dicom zip or nifti) and processed files for
        viewing in the browser. We make a best effort to ensure that outsiders and all other site participants are unable to view
        or access your data. The site is SSL-encrypted and includes the up-to-date user session and authentication features. All user data is stored
        in a password and firewall-protected database. The web app and database are hosted on servers that adhere to high standards for privacy and data
        security. Deidentified raw scan data and intermediate files are also backed up in a secure and SSL-encrypted <a href=https://www.xnat.org>XNAT</a>
        database. Please read the <a target=_blank href=''>Consent Form for Participation in Research</a> for more information.

            Development of the site has been supported in part through an NIMH K01 career development and training award (PI: Spiro Pantazatos).
            The funders had no role in the design, conception and decision to publish the site. We hope this will become a valuable data resource for the
            neuroscience community, and will seek support from federal funding agencies to support research initiatives via the site. We may also consider
            crowdsourcing funding for certain features. With enough support we hope the site will be richly-featured and remain free to the public.

            The Github repository with source code for the site UI/UX is private. We will likely create a public Github repo for segmentation and labeling
            pipelines applied to users' MRI scans. If you would like to be added as a collaborator to the project, please <a href="{{ url_for('public.contact') }}">
              contact</a> us and include a link to your Github profile and a short message
              about your skills and interests. Likewise, to contribute a survey or psychophysics study
              to the site please use the <a href="">researcher application form</a> to tell us bit
              about your experiment (be sure to view the <a href=""> experiments already included </a>on the site).

            Most large universities and research centers have on-going research studies involving brain imaging and that are actively recruiting
            volunteers. If you live near one, we recommend contacting the psychology, neuroscience or psychiatry department to learn about volunteer opportunities.
            If you do participate in a study, you can request your (structural) brain scan on a CD (folder of dicoms or NIFTI file) or USB drive. In the future we
            may provide a form that you can fill out and submit to the lab or clinic where you received your MRI scan in order to authorize
            them to send us your data.
