# If you are a trusted developer and want to use our standard developer keys, the only credentials that need to be set
# here are the credentials for parameter store.  If you are a new developer to the project, you will need at Mail, S3,
# and Cloudfront credentials for full site functionality.  If you are using a local version of XNAT running through a
# virtual machine and have not changed the default credentials, nothing needs to be set here.
